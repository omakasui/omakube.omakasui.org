# Features

How Omakube differs can be found here, in a concise list of features and quality-of-life improvements that make the overall experience smoother and more pleasant.

## Cleaner installation and improved robustness

The installation process has been refined to be more visually polished and less fragile, with logs available in case something goes wrong. By removing the need to handle multiple installation types and focusing solely on delivering a cohesive desktop experience, the flow now centers on preparing the environment for the user. This also allowed a reduction in the number of default apps, keeping only the usual essentials that are easy to remove, without compromising the idea of a fast startup once installation is complete.

The decision not to pursue an ultra-minimal setup aligns with Omakub’s _Omakase Doctrine_ and ensures a ready-to-use environment for those approaching Linux for the first time.

## Wofi App Launcher & Unified Menu

Omakube features seamless integration with [`Wofi`](https://hg.sr.ht/~scoopta/wofi), a powerful application launcher for Wayland. This allows for quick access to applications, themes and, most importantly, a **Unified Menu** for all Omakube features.

## Shell Scripts

A set of scripts, adapted from Omarchy and customized for Omakube, designed to simplify the user experience and integrate seamlessly with its features. Just type `omakub-` in the terminal and press `Tab` to see the full list.

## More Hotkeys

_Yes, using the keyboard is a lot of fun._ <br/>
That's why we've introduced several shortcuts to make it easier to quickly launch apps, navigate Omakube settings, and manage the night light. The plan is to expand them even further!

## More Default Themes and Extra Themes

There are a few more default themes than Omakub: _catppuccin-latte_, _flexoki-light_ , _ethereal_ and _hackerman_.

In addition to these, the ability to import others has been added via a dedicated tool. These can be created by the user or taken from the community.
You can view the extra themes on the [dedicated page](https://omakasui.org/themes) on OmaKasui.org.

## Enhance Extensions

More GNOME extensions have been added to make using the overview and quick settings more pleasant, as well as some updates to existing ones.

Specifically, [`Tactile`](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4548/tactile/)’s grid has been set to 4 columns to provide greater flexibility, [`Icon Launcher`](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/9134/icon-launcher/) adds an icon to the top bar that launches the menu, the [`Quick Settings Tweaks`](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/5446/quick-settings-tweaker/) extension updates the user menu in the GNOME top bar and [`GNOME 4x UI Improvements`](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4158/gnome-40-ui-improvements/) has been included to bring more consistency to the overview.

## Custom Plymouth and GDM3

Omakube comes with _custom Plymouth_ boot screen and _GDM3_ login screen designs, creating a cohesive and consistent visual experience from boot to login that matches the overall desktop theme.

## Kitty

While Alacritty remains the default, I preferred to add the ability to switch to Kitty, aligning it with the existing themes.

## No SNAP!

Yes, exactly — _*no Snap*_. It’s a choice I’ve always made and continue to stick with, to avoid a system bloated with preinstalled software and forced defaults. Rather, I prefer **_Flatpak_** and its architecture. It installs faster and is far less invasive on the system.
